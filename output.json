    "name": "Thanatar Cavas Siege-automata",
    "description": "The Thanatar Siege-automata is a mobile artillery platform rather than a general battle unit, with a heavy frame built to accommodate its huge weaponry and requisite power systems. The Thanatar-Cavas configuration is armed with a Hellex pattern plasma mortar, a terrifying weapon that launches spheres of plasma into the heart of enemy fortifications. The origins of the Thanatar-Cavas remain uncertain, save that its armament is known to be the product of the forge world of Ryza, the sole locale where Hellex pattern weaponry is produced. This multipart plastic kit builds a Thanatar-Cavas Siege-automata, a hulking demolisher robot fielded by the Mechanicum in the age of the Horus Heresy. The Thanatar's primary weapon is a huge shoulder-mounted plasma mortar, which can be built with its firing aperture open or closed. Its arms are tipped with claw-like shock chargers, and its left arm also features a wrist-mounted twin mauler bolt cannon. The kit features plenty of posing options to personalise your Thanatar-Cavas, including joints for the waist and shoulders, three right arm poses, two left arm poses with ammo feeds to match, and the ability to build the shock chargers in different grabbing positions. This kit contains 175 plastic components and a Citadel 120mm Round Base.

Carried into battle by their Incunabulan jet packs, the Thallax operate with a surgical lack of emotion, leveraging their remaining capacity for independent thought to destroy the enemies of the Omnissiah. This multipart plastic kit builds six Thallax, elite bionic destroyers created by the Mechanicum in the age of the Horus Heresy. Each Thallax is armed with a powerful lightning gun, which can be outfitted with a chain bayonet. The kit includes optional melta bombs for every model, as well as an arsenal of special weapons to replace the lightning guns \u2013 you'll find a pair of phased plasma-fusils, photon thrusters, and multi-meltas.

The organic human bodies of the tech-thralls, already altered to lift heavy loads and function in hostile environments, are fitted with basic weapons systems and bodily protection. On the battlefield they serve as expendable troops, unskilled but relentless and indefatigable \u2013 an army of the alive-yet-dead, puppeted by the magi who command them.

When they get close enough to bring them to bear, the manic energy of their pilots makes up for the clumsy mechanisms bringing their melee weapons to bear, creating a shockingly effective whirlwind of claws and blades. This multipart metal kit builds a classic Ork Dreadnought, a vintage design for a crudely articulated can of heavy armour and brutal weapons. This stompy combat walker comes armed with two Dread klaws \u2013 one a snippy pincer, the other a razor-toothed buzzsaw \u2013 and can choose between a big shoota, rokkit launcher, and skorcha for its two secondary weapons.
